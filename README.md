# Learning Terraform

This repository is a clone of [Terraform: Up & Running Code](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code). The doc below is 
the one from this repository. I have added my own folders:

* [my_code](my_code): code based in the samples from the forked repo
* [swarm_cluster](swarm_cluster): swarm cluster deployed with Terraform and configured with ansible

## Terraform: Up & Running Code

This repo contains the code samples for the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)*,
2nd edition, by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).

### Quick start

All the code is in the [code](/code) folder. It is organized by language (terraform, bash, ruby, etc) and within each
language, by chapter. Since this code comes from a book about Terraform, the vast majority of the code consists of
Terraform examples in the [code/terraform folder](/code/terraform). 

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the 
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book.
